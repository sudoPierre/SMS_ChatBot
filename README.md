# SMS ChatBot (Powered by TextBee.dev)

A Python-based SMS chatbot that leverages the [TextBee.dev](https://textbee.dev) SMS Gateway and its webhook feature to receive and respond to SMS messages using Perplexity AI. The bot supports message history, sender whitelisting, and logging.

This project is now fully cloud-based ‚Äî no need for GSM hardware or Raspberry Pi.

## Warning

## How It Works

1. A user sends an SMS to your TextBee number.
2. TextBee forwards the message to your hosted webhook.
3. The webhook receives and processes the SMS.
4. The chatbot queries Perplexity AI and generates a response.
5. The response is sent back to the user via TextBee.

## Logs

The bot logs the following information:
- Incoming phone numbers and messages
- Timestamps of interactions
- AI responses

All logs are stored in the local `logs/` directory (one file per session or day depending on configuration).
